- Optimize file size

### Step 2: Rename Files
Rename your images to match the exact filenames listed above:
- `pearl-millet.jpg`
- `white-sorghum.jpg`
- `basmati-rice.jpg`
- etc.

### Step 3: Upload to Folder

## TEMPORARY SOLUTION

If you don't have all images yet, you can:

1. **Use placeholder images** - Add any product image temporarily with the correct filename
2. **Use the same image** - Copy one image 8 times with different names
3. **Add images gradually** - Add them one by one as you collect photos

The website will work with any images in these locations, so you can start with placeholders and replace them with actual product photos later.
