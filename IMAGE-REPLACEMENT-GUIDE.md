## QUICK START

To get your website fully functional, you need to add these 2 images immediately:

1. **food-grains.jpg** - Image of grains (pearl millet, sorghum, rice, pulses)
2. **whole-spices.jpg** - Image of spices (mustard seeds, cumin, coriander)

Place them in: `assets/images/`

The rest of the images are already present or can be added later as you collect product photos and videos.

## NOTES

- The logo (Arakozia-icon.png) is already in place
- Hero slider images are already present
- Gallery images are already present
- You can use placeholder images temporarily and replace them with actual product photos later
- Videos are optional - if you don't have videos, you can hide the video section or use images instead

## NEED HELP?

If you need to:
- Hide sections without images (like videos)
- Use placeholder images
- Adjust image sizes or layouts
